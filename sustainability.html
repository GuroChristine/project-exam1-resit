<h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>
<p>Sustainability tourism is important to us. Our world has amazing<br>
    natural resources, and it is important that future generations can<br>
    enjoy them as well. Not only do we want ensure we donâ€™t damage<br>
    natural resources and local communities, but we want to work<br>
    together to help them flourish.</p>

<h2>Ethical travel</h2>
<p>our trips are planned with both environmental and cultural sustainability<br>
    in mind, with the goal of leaving the smallest ecological footprint on the<br>
    hiking area. Participants are expected to respect their hiking trail and<br>
    behave accordingly.</p>

<h2>Local connections</h2>
<p>Adventure trails works closely with local organizations to ensure that<br>
    much of the profit goes back to the local communities. This may be in the<br>
    form of infrastructure and trail maintenance to supporting local<br>
    businesses and communities, </p>

<h2>Respect for nature</h2>
<p>Many of our hikes include extra activities such as bird watching and<br>
    short courses on edible local plants.</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>In the interest of cultural exchange and sustainability adventure trails<br>
    also include cultural activities, which include experiences of various local<br>
    customs, dress, theatre, dance, and music.</p>
