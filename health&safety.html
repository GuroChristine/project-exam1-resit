    <h1>HEALTH & SAFETY</h1>

    <h2>Be prepared</h2>
    <p>Adventure trails has your enjoyment in mind, and this is also based on<br>
        your safety and well-being. While we will always do our utmost to ensure<br>
        an pleasurable trek, it helps if you prepare yourself. Read up on the trip<br>
        you are going to take, look at the links we provide, and make sure you<br>
        come with suitable clothing and footwear.</p>

    <h2>Be realistic</h2>
    <p>Scaling a 2,000 meter summit may seem possible from the perspective<br>
        of your living room, but you need to make sure you are in good enough<br>
        shape to do so! While it may be tempting to book the most demanding<br>
        trail for your first hike, it may make sense to start with something a little<br>
        easier. If you have a medical condition this also should be taken into<br>
        account. Some trips may require vaccinations, be sure to check on the<br>
        details provided.</p>

    <h2>Be humble</h2>
    <p>Some cultures may frown on certain forms of dress or behavior, and it is<br>
        expected that our travelers respect these customs, regardless of<br>
        weather or not one agrees with them. Our environmental policy is<br>
        “leaving place tidier than you found it”. It is takes as a given that our<br>
        guests show respect for the environment, such the future travelers<br>
        also may enjoy it.</p>
